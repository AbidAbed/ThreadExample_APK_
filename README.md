# ThreadExample_APK_

An apk app shows how threads working in android 

**** just run it on any android device or emulator 

**** the project shows that the main thread (activity) that displays things on the screen *CAN NOT* do background things

**** the project uses another thread in background to load progressbar

**** you can access directly the apk and install it on your android device just got to : \app\app-debug.apk

That's all :)))
